summary: |
  A workflow for high-throughput RNA-seq data analyses.
description: |
  This workflow is designed to process high-throughput RNA-seq data, where every
  well of a microarray plate is a sample. A fasta file provided as input
  defines the mapping between sample barcodes and wells.

  The workflow is built in a modular fashion, where most of the base functionality
  is provided by components from [`biobox`](https://www.viash-hub.com/packages/biobox/latest)
  supplemented by custom base components and workflow components in this package.

  The full workflow is split in two major subworkflows that can be run independently:

  * **Well-demultiplexing:** Split the input (plate/pool level) fastq files per well.
  * **Mapping, counting and QC:** Run per-well mapping, counting and generate QC reports.

  Each of those can be started individually, or the full workflow can be run in two ways:

  1. Run the [main workflow](https://www.viash-hub.com/packages/htrnaseq/v0.3.0/components/workflows/htrnaseq) 
  containing the main functionality.
  2. Run the [(opinionated) `runner`](https://www.viash-hub.com/packages/htrnaseq/v0.3.0/components/workflows/runner) where a
  number of choices (input/output structure and location) have been made.

  Input for the workflow has to be `fastq` files (zipped or not). For bcl or other formats, please consider running
  [demultiplex](https://www.viash-hub.com/packages/demultiplex) first.
