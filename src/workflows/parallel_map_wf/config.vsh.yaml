description: |
  Map RNA sequencing data, provided as fastq files (paired-end) to a reference genome using STAR Solo.
  Input data must have been demultiplexed beforehand, meaning that a single fastq pair provides data for
  one barcode (one well). Multiple wells can be mapped in parallel by providing multiple events to the 
  workflow. Output is provided as mapped output per pool, i.e. one output is provided per pool.
